# Deep learning tutorial
This repository gives some startup examples for deep learning. We use Pytorch to constrcut neural networks.

- In `CNN_MNIST.ipynb`, we constrcuted several layers of [**Convolution Neural Networks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) to classify digital image data, called [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
- We get **99.6%** accuracy with only 5 epochs of training.
